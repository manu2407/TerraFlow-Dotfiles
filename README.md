**TerraFlow** is a comprehensive dotfiles repository designed to transform a stock **CachyOS** (or Arch Linux) installation into a high-performance, visually stunning, and fully automated workspace. It leverages the power of **Hyprland**, **Waybar**, **AGS**, and a suite of custom scripts to provide a seamless "TerraFlow" experience.

## 🚀 Features

- **Window Management**: Highly configured **Hyprland** with smooth animations and intuitive keybinds.
- **Status Bar**: Custom **Waybar** with modules for system info, media, and more.
- **Widgets**: **AGS** (Aylur's GTK Shell) for advanced widgets and on-screen displays.
- **Terminal**: **Kitty** terminal with **Fish** shell and **Starship** prompt for a modern command-line experience.
- **File Management**: **Yazi** for blazing fast terminal file navigation.
- **App Launcher**: **NWG-Drawer** and **Wofi** for quick app access.
- **Package Management**: Custom **Terra Store** TUI installer for interactive package management.
- **Aesthetics**: Unified theming with **Tokyo Night** colors, blurred lockscreens, and consistent fonts (Iosevka, Inter).
- **Tools**: Pre-configured **Lazygit**, **MPV** (with UOSC), **VS Code** extensions, and **Docker** setup.
